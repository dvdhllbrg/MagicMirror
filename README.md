Magic Mirror
===

Inspired by [Michael Teeuw's project](https://github.com/MichMich/MagicMirror), this is my own attempt at a magic mirror interface. (Actual mirror still in production.)

Backend is powered by an Express server, and uses Angular for frontend rendition.

Configuration variables, API keys and OAuth secrets are stored in config.json.
